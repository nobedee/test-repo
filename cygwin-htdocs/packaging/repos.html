<h1>git repositories for Cygwin packaging</h1>

<p>
Hosting is provided for a central collection of repositories used by package
mantainers to keep their cygwin packaging under version control.
</p>

<p>
After you have provided an <a href="key.html#sshkey">SSH key</a>,
package maintainers can push to these git repositories, like so:
</p>

<code class="sample-preformat">
  git push cygwin@cygwin.com:/git/cygwin-packages/<i>packagename</i>
</code>

<p>
  or, you can configure that as the default URL for pushing with:
</p>
<code class="sample-preformat">
  git remote set-url --push origin cygwin@cygwin.com:/git/cygwin-packages/<i>packagename</i>
</code>

<p>
where <i>packagename</i> is a package name you are listed as a maintainer for in
<a href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-pkg-maint">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-pkg-maint</a>.
</p>

<p>
These repositories are lazily created on the first push.
</p>

<p>
If you are adopting a package, but the repository is empty or missing, ask on
cygwin-apps for it's history to be imported
with <a href="https://github.com/jon-turney/ctm2git">ctm2git</a>
</p>

<p>
Since it's intended that these repositories will only contain cygport scripts,
patches, and other packaging files, and to prevent the accidental committing of
upstream archives, pushes containing large binary files are rejected.
</p>

<p>For testing and experimentation purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A repository for the package name <code>playground</code> exists, that all
    maintainers can create, push, force-push, rewind and delete branches in.
  </li>
  <li>
    All package repositories allow the maintainer(s) to create, push, rewind and
    delete a branch named <code>playground</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
These repositories are viewable via
<a href="https://cygwin.com/cgit/cygwin-packages/">cgit</a>, and are cloneable
via anonymous git or http with the URLs shown there.
