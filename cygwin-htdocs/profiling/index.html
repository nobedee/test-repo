<h1>Profiling Cygwin</h1>

<p>There are a couple of steps you need to do to profile cygwin itself
(newlib and winsup).  This is preliminary documentation but ought to
be applicable to the Beta 20.1 net release.  Don't expect things to go
smoothly.</p>

<p>From the Cygwin development tools source distribution, configure,
build, and install gprof.</p>

<p>Delete all of your <code>.o</code>'s in newlib and winsup.  Rebuild
them all with profiling options:</p>

<pre>
make -k -w CFLAGS='-pg -O2 -g' CXXFLAGS='-pg -O2 -g'
</pre>

<p>
Note: the dll builds will fail; this is OK.  You're not going to use
those dlls.  <b>Make sure</b> you have a working <code>cygwin.dll</code>
available and <b>do not</b> touch or rename it.  You'll need it.</p>

<p>OK, now go into winsup and <b>delete</b> <code>mcount.o</code>,
<code>gcrt0.o</code>, <code>gmon.o</code>, and <code>profil.o.</code> Rebuild
those without <code>-pg</code>.  It is possible that <code>mcount.c</code>
<b>must</b> be built without <code>-O</code> (this was a problem once,
at least) - so just use <code>-g</code> for that one.</p>

<p>Next, you need to build new libraries for newlib and winsup that
contain these objects.  Here's <a href="prof-script">a script</a>
to do it.</p>

<p>You will also need a standalone malloc package.
<a href="djmalloc.c">Here's one from djgpp</a> that we
modified to work for this context.</p>

<p>Now that you have <code>libcpg.a</code>, <code>libwinpg.a</code>, and
<code>malloc.o</code>, you can build your programs like this:</p>

<pre>
CFLAGS = -g -pg -O2

D = djmalloc.o libwinpg.a libcpg.a libwinpg.a

test.exe : test.c $D
	gcc -pg -g -o test.exe test.c $D -lgdi32 -luser32

gmon.out : test.exe
	./test.exe

test.gp : gmon.out
	gprof -b test.exe > test.gp
</pre>
