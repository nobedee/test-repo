<h1>Mirror Sites</h1>

<p>The following sites have generously agreed to mirror our Cygwin
package repository. To save on download time, please select a mirror near you
when using <code>setup</code>
to <a href="install.html">install or update</a> Cygwin.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> We <em>automatically</em> poll these mirrors periodically to
ensure that they have the latest <a href="packages">Cygwin packages</a>
available.  The list of mirrors below reflects all of the mirrors who appear to
have up-to-date copies of the Cygwin package repository.</p>

<p>
<b>There is <a href="#mirroradmin">more information for Mirror Administrators</a>.</b><br/>
</p>

<h2 class="cartouche" id="sitelist">Mirror site list</h2>

<!-- include mirror list updated by check-cygwin-mirrors run from cygwin-admin's crontab -->
<!--#include virtual="mirrors-list.html"-->

<tr><td><h2 class="center">Mirror Administrators: Read This!</h2>

<p>If you would like to be added to this list of available mirrors then send
email to the <a href="mailto:cygwin@cygwin.com">cygwin mailing list</a>. When
you send your message, remember that this site does not accept html-formatted
email.
</p>

<p>When asking to be added, please provide a contact email, the URL
of the mirror, and the location of the mirror (in a similar format to that
used for existing mirrors in the <a href="#sitelist">mirror site list</a>).
Make sure that your mirror rsyncs directly from cygwin.com at least
twice a day.</p>

<p>You can also send an email if you would like your mirror to be removed from
this list.</p>

<p>Please do not send questions asking how to set up a mirror.  We don't
provide technical support for setting up mirrors.  Sorry.</p>

<p>The mirror list is <a href="mirrors-report.html"><b>automatically
maintained</b></a> so that only active mirrors are listed. A mirror
is <em>temporarily</em> removed from the list if it remains out of date for more
than 24 hours. If your mirror was dropped from the list, do not panic. It means
that a program has determined that the content on your mirror is not up-to-date.
Ensure that your mirror is up-to-date. It will be added again automatically once
it has has up-to-date content.
<em>There is no need to contact anyone about this</em>.</p>

<p>
Mirrors which remain out-of-date for more than 28 days are manually reviewed
(sporadically), and disabled if the owner is unresponsive.
