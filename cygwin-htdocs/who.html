<h1>Who are we?*</h1>
<ul class="spaced">

<li>Cygwin was initially developed by Cygnus Solutions (Now Red Hat,
Inc.) but the majority of package maintainership and a significant
percentage of Cygwin development is handled by non-Red Hat
volunteers.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://sourceware.org/cygwin-apps/setup.html">Cygwin setup</a> project
is currently maintained by various package maintainers.</li>

<li>Corinna Vinschen (corinna) is the project lead.
Corinna is a senior <a href="https://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> engineer.
Corinna is responsible for such important subsystems as security,
networking, and internationalization.</li>

<li>Jon Turney is a project lead for <a href="http://x.cygwin.com/">Cygwin/X</a>
and is responsible for improvements to the X server.
He has also contributed several improvements to setup.
</li>

<li>Eric Blake (eblake) maintains bash, coreutils, and several other
vitally important packages.</li>

<li>Like many <a href="https://sourceware.org/sourcecode.html">free software projects</a> on
sourceware.org, contributions from net people are especially
important.  Cygwin benefits from thousands of testers and dozens of
contributors, including some incredible people like Sergey Okhapkin,
Egor Duda, Chuck Wilson, David Starks-Browning, Kazuhiro Fujieda, Jason
Tishler, Robert Collins, David Billinghurst, Joshua Daniel Franklin,
Chris January, Conrad Scott, Pavel Tsekov, Pierre Humblet, Igor
Peshansky, Brian Dessent, Brian Ford, Jari Aalto, Ken Brown, and Marco Atzeri.</li>
</ul>
<br/><p>* Please note that all of the people above prefer that project related
communications go to the proper mailing list rather than private email.</p>
