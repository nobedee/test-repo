# Updating the gold star page

The gold star page is generated from a page template and a database of awardees,
award types, and awards. To update the page:

1. `cd src`
2. Add the new award entry(ies) to awards.csv.
3. Add corresponding new entries to awardees.csv and award_types.csv, if needed.
4. Run `make`. This will regenerate ../index.html.
5. `cd ..` and commit and push the changes in git.

`make` runs `make_awards_list.pl`, which rebuilds index.html based on the contents
of the following files:

awards.csv
	: list of awards: awardee, URL reference, description, and counts of each different
	  award type awarded.
awardees.csv
	: list of people who've received awards: initials, name, and obfuscated email address.
award_types.csv
	: list of different award types: name, image file, and default award count.
index.html.tpl
	: template file for index.html. This is just index.html with a placeholder for where
	  the award list should be inserted.

For each award, if all of the award counts are empty or missing, the default award counts
from award_types.csv are applied.  This allows you to skip entering a bunch of zeros or the
default single gold star in every award.
