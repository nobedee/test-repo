                framebuffer to the updated Win32 window instead of
                blitting from a GDI shadow framebuffer. This should
                be easy to start and should require only
                a single DirectDraw surface for the whole screen.
                It would be very important to
                just demonstrate that this can be done; clipping
                the blits to properly handle window z-order and
                such can be finished.</p></td>

                (typically 8-bit palette-based visuals) on top of
                the default TrueColor visual (when running in 15,
                16, 24, or 32 bit color depths). This will allow a
                lot of CAD-type applications that require
                PseudoColor to be run when Windows is in a color
                mode higher than 8 bits per pixel. The general idea
                here is to add checks to any copying of data
                between offscreen and onscreen, as well as between
                areas on the screen; these checks test for
                differing visual types and convert the pixels and
                colors accordingly.</p>

                DirectDraw engines to support PseudoColor visuals
                when running in 8 bit color modes. DirectDraw
                reserves the first ten and the last ten colors in
                each DirectDrawPalette object when running in
                windowed mode. Therefore, PseudoColor visuals are
                only supported with DirectDraw engines when running
                in fullscreen 8 bit color modes.</p></td>
