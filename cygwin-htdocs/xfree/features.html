    <h1>Features</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Cost - Cygwin/X is free for use.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Modifiability - Cygwin/X source code is freely
            available for modification.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Color Depths - Supports all color depths supported
            by Windows.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Multi-Window Mode - Multi-Window mode allows each X
            Client to be opened in, and managed by, its own Windows
            window. This makes each X Client show up independently
            in the task bar. Additionally, the icon hint provided
            by the X Client is used for the Windows window
            icon.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Rootless Mode - Rootless mode makes the root window
            for the X Server be transparent, making all of the X
            Clients float over the other Windows windows. Rootless
            mode requires an external window manager, such as twm,
            openbox, fvwm2, WindowMaker, etc.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Fullscreen Mode - Fullscreen mode allows the entire
            display to be taken over by Cygwin/X, which works
            particularly well when logging into a remote XDM
            server.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>No Decoration Mode - No Decoration mode creates a
            full-sized root window (not to be used with Fullscreen,
            Multi-Window, or Rootless modes) without any Windows
            window decorations (title bar, border, etc.).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Clipboard Integration - Clipboard integration
            between the X clipboard and the Windows clipboard.
            Supports text only. Works with Unicode and MBCS strings
            for non-U.S. locales.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Remote Logins - Remote logins to XDM (X Display
            Manager) services are supported, allowing the entire
            session to be managed by a remote machine. Coupled with
            Full Screen mode, Cygwin/X can be used as an
            alternative to a KVM switch for *nix machines on your
            local network.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Remote Clients - Remote clients can be launched and
            displayed in your Cygwin/X session either via telnet or
            via X11 tunneling over ssh, using either Cygwin's
            openssh package, PuTTY, or any other ssh client.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Remote Access - You can use Cygwin's openssh package
            and its sshd daemon to allow X11 tunneling of
            applications from your Windows machine to other
            machines on your network. For example, you can launch
            emacs on your Windows machine and use it to view and
            edit files remotely from any other machine with an X
            Server.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>DirectDraw Acceleration - Every mode except for the
            current Multi-Window mode supports acceleration via
            DirectDraw.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>OpenGL Graphics - The
            <a href="http://www.mesa3d.org">Mesa 3D Graphics
            Library</a> provides software-based OpenGL support.
            There is experimental support for
            hardware-accelerated OpenGL provided using the native
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGL_%28software%29">WGL</a>
            interface.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Non-U.S. Keyboard Layouts - Many non-U.S. keyboard
            layouts are detected automatically, causing the
            appropriate keyboard map to be loaded. Keyboard layouts
            that are not automatically detected can be added to the
            list of automatically supported layouts easily upon
            request.  Command line configuration support is also provided to
            allow manually specifying a keyboard layout.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>AltGr Support - Cygwin/X properly handles the AltGr
            key used in many non-U.S. keyboard layouts and passes
            this key on to each particular X Client for further
            processing.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Start Menu Icons - Windows Start Menu icons are
            provided to launch installed X Clients (such as xterm,
            xeyes, emacs, etc.).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Tray Icon - A tray icon is provided to indicate that
            the server is running, to allow easy access to the Exit
            command, and to toggle visibility of the root window in
            Multiwindow mode.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Configurable Tray Icon Menu - Menu entries can be
            added to the configurable tray icon menu via a .XWinrc
            file in the user's home directory, or via a
            system.XWinrc file in /etc/X11.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
              Resize support - Integrates native Window or monitor
              resizing with the RANDR extension.
            </p>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Maybe Features</h1>
    <ul>

        <li>
            <p>Support - Free support may be available in the Cygwin/X
            mailing list. The people answering questions are
            usually the same people that wrote the software, so
            they can often fix a problem if one is discovered.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
            Windows Versions - Supports Windows 2000,
            Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008,
            and Windows 7.
            <i>
            In theory, all Windows versions supported by Cygwin are supported by Cygwin/X.
            In practice, it is untested with versions prior to Windows XP and possibly broken.
            </i>
            </p>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Ex-Features</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>PseudoColor - 8 bit PseudoColor (palletized color)
            support in Full Screen mode (-fullscreen) and when
            running Windows in an 8 bit color depth.<i>Who knows if this
            still works?</i></p>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Non-Features</h1>
    <p>Some things which Cygwin/X just can't do</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Make your Windows desktop accessible over the network.
	       (This problem is solved by
	       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing">VNC</a> or
	       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol">RDP</a>)</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Magically make native Windows applications be able to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_transparency">
	       run on one computer and display on a different computer</a>.</p>
