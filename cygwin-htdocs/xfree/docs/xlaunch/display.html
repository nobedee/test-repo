<h2><a name="1"></a>Display settings</h2>
This dialog sets the way the X server displays programs.
Select the display settings appropriate to your requirements.
<h3><a name="2"></a>Multiple windows</h3>
Start the integrated Microsoft Windows-based window manager which launches each top-level X window in its own Windows window. Use this mode if you don't understand the others.
<h3><a name="3"></a>One window</h3>
The X server appears as a single Windows window and all X windows are contained within this window. This mode requires an external window manager. Typically this mode would be used for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDMCP"><img src="moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">XDMCP</a> login to a remote machine.<p>
The default window size is roughly the size of useful area of the primary monitor.  This can be altered by using the '-screen' parameter
on the <a href="additional.html" title="XLaunch Additional parameters">Additional parameters</a> page of this wizard.
<h3><a name="4"></a>Fullscreen</h3>
This mode is like single window mode except that the X server window takes the full screen, covering completely the Windows desktop. This mode requires an external window manager.
<h3><a name="5"></a>One window without titlebar</h3>
This mode is like single window mode except that the X server window does not have a title bar or border, thus maximizing the amount of space available for X windows within the X server window. This mode requires an external window manager.
<h3><a name="6"></a>Display number</h3>
The display (or X Window server) number (default 0).<p>
The phrase <i>display</i> is usually used to refer to a collection of physical monitors that share a common keyboard and mouse.<p>
On starting, the server creates a TCP end point and listens on port 6000+<i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is the display number. When a client is started on another host, it creates a TCP end point and connects to port 6000+<i>n</i> on the server. Each client gets its own TCP connection to the server.
<h2><a name="7"></a>X clients and servers</h2>
At first glance the terms client and server in an X Window system appear backwards. Think of the server as the end providing the service. The service provided by X is access to the window, keyboard and mouse.
