<H2>NAME</H2>

xwinclip - An X11 and Windows clipboard integration tool
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>xwinclip [OPTION]...</B>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>xwinclip</I> is a tool for copying and pasting text between the Windows and X11 clipboard systems.
<P>
<I>xwinclip</I> watches for updates to either clipboard and copies data between them when either one is updated.
<P>
<I>xwinclip</I> monitors the X PRIMARY and CLIBPOARD selections for changes in ownership, and makes
the contents of the most recent one to change available to paste from the Windows clipboard.
<P>
It also monitors the contents of the Windows clipboard for changes, taking ownership of the PRIMARY and
CLIPBOARD selections, and making the contents of the Windows clipboard available in them.
<P>
<B>Note well:</B>

The <I><A HREF="../man1/XWin.1.html">XWin</A>(1)</I> X server has internal clipboard integration that is enabled by default.
Do <I>NOT</I> run <I>xwinclip</I> unless <I><A HREF="../man1/XWin.1.html">XWin</A>(1)</I> has been started with the -noclipboard option.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>

<H2>BUGS</H2>

Only text clipboard contents are supported.
<P>
The INCR (Incremental transfer) clipboard protocol for clipboard contents larger than the maximum size of an X
request (approximately 256K) is only supported for X -&gt; Windows clipboard transfers.
<P>
Some X clients, notably ones written in Tcl/Tk, do not re-assert ownership of the PRIMARY selection or update
its timestamp when its contents change, which currently prevents <I>xwinclip</I> from correctly noticing that
the PRIMARY selection's contents have changed.
<P>
Windows clipboard rendering is synchronous in the WM_RENDER*FORMAT message (that is, we must have placed the
contents onto the clipboard by the time we return from processing this message), but we must wait for the X
client which owns the selection to convert the selection to our requested format.  This is currently achieved
using a fixed timeout.  After requesting conversion of the selection, if no events are received from the X
client which owns the selection for one second, the conversion is assumed to have failed.
<P>
The <A HREF="../man1/XWin.1.html">XWin</A>(1) server should indicate somehow (by placing an atom on the root window?) that it is running with its
internal clipboard integration enabled, and xwinclip should notice this and exit with an appropriate error.
<P>
Probably many other bugs.
