<h1>Is there a mailing list for the project?</h1>

<p>Yes.  There are several.  They are listed below.</p>

<h2 class="cartouche" id="see-above">I have a question!  Should I just send it to one of the mailing lists below?</h2>

<p>
  Before you send any mail to one of these lists, please check out
  the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>, the
  <a href="cygwin-ug-net.html">documentation</a>,
  the <a href="https://google.com/">web</a> and the mailing list archives (click
  on a mailing list name <a href="#available-lists">below</a> to view the
  archive), so that you don't ask a question that someone has already asked or
  report a bug that has already been reported.
</p>

<p>
  If you searched those information sources and came up blank, there are a lot
  of friendly folk who will probably try to answer your questions.  Please
  consider our <a href="problems.html">problem reporting guidelines</a>, so that
  you ask in a way which allows the folks on the list to answer your
  question <b>most easily</b>. Vague, content-free, or repetitive queries or
  observations are not likely to get a useful answer.
</p>

<h2 class="cartouche" id="available-lists">Cygwin Mailing Lists</h2>

<ul class="spaced">
  <li id="cygwin"><a href="/mailman/listinfo/cygwin/"><b>cygwin</b></a>:
  This is the list for <a href="#see-above">discussion</a> of just about all
  things related to Cygwin. <b>In general, you should send questions and bug
  reports here.</b>  If you have questions about how to use Cygwin, or if you
  have <em>Cygwin-specific</em> (<a href="#see-above">see above</a>) questions,
  <a href="problems.html">problems</a>, or observations about the UNIX tools
  (bash, gcc, make, etc.) that come with Cygwin, this is the list for you
  (although it's very possible that you will receive more qualified help for
  such tools on their specific mailing lists).
  </li>

  <br/><ul class="compact">
    <li>If you've received Cygwin from a 3rd party, modified by them, and/or
      bundled in with some other software, you should contact them with your
      problems and questions.
      <em>This caveat applies to all of the mailing lists at this site.</em></li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li id="cygwin-announce"><a href="/mailman/listinfo/cygwin-announce/"><b>cygwin-announce</b></a>:
  a moderated list solely for announcements related to the
  official Cygwin release.
  </li>

  <li id="cygwin-apps"><a href="/mailman/listinfo/cygwin-apps/"><b>cygwin-apps</b></a>:
  a subscribers-only list for <em>package maintainers</em> to discuss
  <a href="packages.html">packaging</a> issues regarding applications that are
  distributed in Cygwin.  <b>Do not subscribe if you are not
  interested in being a package maintainer.</b> If you are maintaining or
  volunteering to maintain one of the packages that is distributed in
  Cygwin or a new package, you should be subscribed to this list.  This list is
  intended for discussing solutions.  It is <b>not</b> for
  <em>bug reports</em>, <em>"it would be nice"</em>, or <em>"how do I"</em>
  type of musings.  Do not subscribe to this mailing list to ask questions
  about packages.  Use the main Cygwin mailing list for that.
  </li>

  <li id="cygwin-developers"><a href="/mailman/listinfo/cygwin-developers/"><b>cygwin-developers</b></a>:
  a subscribers-only list for <b>discussing the internals of the Cygwin DLL</b>
  and all cygwin components of the "winsup" directory.  Discussion of upcoming
  releases is also appropriate.  Please do not subscribe or send email to this
  list if you do not understand what is meant by "the winsup directory".
  <br/><br/>If you are interested in <a href="contrib.html">contributing</a> to
  the development of Cygwin, this is the place to discuss your plans.
  If you have an issue and hope that someone will look into it for you then
  please do not send email here.  This is a mailing list for doers not musers.
  </li>

  <li id="cygwin-patches"><a href="/mailman/listinfo/cygwin-patches/"><b>cygwin-patches</b></a>:
  a subscribers-only list for <b>submitting patches to the Cygwin DLL</b> and the other
  components of the "winsup" directory.  Discussions of supplied patches are
  also acceptable, of course.
  </li>

  <li id="cygwin-cvs"><a href="/mailman/listinfo/cygwin-cvs/"><b>cygwin-cvs</b></a>:
  a read-only list which receives log messages for every Git commit in the
  'winsup' directory.  If you don't know what this means then you probably
  shouldn't subscribe.  Messages consist of a log message and pointers to
  diffs of the changes.
  </li>

  <li id="cygwin-apps-cvs"><a href="/mailman/listinfo/cygwin-apps-cvs/"><b>cygwin-apps-cvs</b></a>:
  a read-only list which receives log messages for every Git and (back in the days) CVS
  commit in the 'cygwin-apps' repository.  If you don't know what this means
  then you probably shouldn't subscribe.  Messages consist of a log message
  and pointers to diffs of the changes.</li>
